# YogaAssist

YogaAssist is an AI-powered yoga assistant application that helps users improve their yoga practice by providing real-time pose correction, recommendations for personalized yoga routines, and access to curated content. The project leverages Python with OpenCV for pose detection, the Gemini API for accessing relevant yoga content, a recommendation system for tailored routines, and a React-based frontend for a smooth user experience.
